        <p><em>Pet Dog at Household</em></p>
        <p>I have worked as a Pet Dog at Household for just over 1 year. It is my first job and I hope to stay in it forever. It's the best since I get to sleep and play and eat whenever I want. The only work I have to do is occasionally follow my owners' commands and sit patiently while getting groomed.</p>
